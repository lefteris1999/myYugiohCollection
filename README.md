Collecting and keeping track of cards in your collection can quickly become too frustrating and hard to stay on top of, especially as you keep collecting throughout the years.
So I started keeping track of the cards that i have at my disposal, initially by logging their names, sets, rarities and how many copies I had, in Excel.
As I kept cataloguing my collection, I realised that there is a lot of information there, and as a Data Scientist, data is my gold.
And thus i started this python notebook, to analyse, extract information and practise/develop my data science skills on a topic that i like.
